### Prototypal inheritance
1. Constructor Function Inheritance: Create a Dog(can log bark the amount of times as many legs as it has) class which is inherited from  Wolf (can howl and log awooo) which is inherited from Mammal (has legsCountProperty) 
2. Class Based Inheritance: Create a Dog(can log bark the amount of times as many legs as it has) class which is inherited from  Wolf (can howl and log awooo) which is inherited from Mammal (has legsCountProperty)
